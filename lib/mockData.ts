We regret to inform you that due to a severe snowstorm impacting the East Coast, there will be a 1-week delay in delivering the portable speaker systems for Order #SW-2847.

Affected Equipment: ProSound PX-500 Portable Speaker Systems
Original Delivery Date: February 10, 2026
Revised Delivery Date: February 17, 2026

The snowstorm has caused significant disruptions to our distribution network, and our warehouse facility in New Jersey has been temporarily closed due to unsafe road conditions.

We understand this may impact your upcoming event schedule and are committed to working with you to find alternative solutions.

Please contact us immediately if you need to discuss expedited shipping options or alternative arrangements.

Best regards,
SoundWave Pro Audio`,
